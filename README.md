This project is a personal project of mine to pracice using react. It is a basic CV-Maker and I did it to practice using things like props and state in react. 
Also during development I kept in mind the concept of not everything needs state so instead of every component using state I had all state stored in the App.jsx component and if the state needed to change I would pass a state handling function down to the respective child component as props.
Overall, this project was fun and good practice for using react.

Here is a basic diagram showing the components of the app and how they all interact with the state in the App.jsx component.
